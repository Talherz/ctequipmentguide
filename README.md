## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).

## E-commerce Catalog Proof‑of‑Concept

This repository has been extended with a simple e‑commerce catalog built with Next.js and Supabase.
The goal of the catalog is to provide a modern Amazon‑style browsing experience with search, vendor
and category filters, product detail pages, a shopping cart, checkout, and account management.

The implementation is broken down into small pull requests. The first pull request introduces the
layout shell, navigation bar with search, sidebar with vendor/category filters, an empty grid on
the `/products` page, and route stubs for product details, cart, checkout and account pages.

### Environment variables

To run the catalog locally or deploy it on Vercel you will need to provide a few Supabase keys in
your environment:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` – your Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://xyzcompany.supabase.co`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY` – the Supabase anon (publishable) API key.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` – a Supabase service role key (required later for inserting orders).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` – the base URL for your deployment. This defaults to `http://localhost:3000`
  in development and is used when generating absolute URLs in emails.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and set the above variables. When deploying to
Vercel, configure the same variables in the Vercel dashboard.

### Running locally

1. Clone the repository and change into the project directory.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (create one if it does not exist) and set the environment variables described above.
3. Install dependencies and start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products) to view the catalog. The
   home page from the starter kit remains available at `/`.

### Previewing on Vercel

Deploy the project to Vercel either via the GitHub integration or using the Vercel CLI. Ensure the
environment variables are configured in the Vercel dashboard. Once deployed, visit
`https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/products` to access the catalog.

Later pull requests will flesh out server side rendering for `/products`, Supabase queries,
pagination, cart functionality, checkout order insertion, email notifications via Formbricks, and
account‑level order history.
